# Pikachu visits Wellington

It was a beautiful sunny day as Pikachu stepped off the ferry.

For some reason, there was a huge queue outside EDA. Of people dancing.

They were doing the Macarena while wearing animal hats.

But wait, they weren't dancing, they were evolving!

All of a sudden there is a huge explosion! A few people scream, but then a "whoop!" goes up, as the explosion is GLITTER!

As Eevee arrived, the crowd cheered and the strobelights started!

All of the people evolved to a storm of Pikachus.
